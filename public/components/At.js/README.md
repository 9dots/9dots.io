**Add Github like mentions autocomplete to your application.** [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ichord/At.js.png)](https://travis-ci.org/ichord/At.js)


### Hi
Let me know you are using it, so I will work harder on it.
And if you like **At.js** ?! Tell me by adding website [here](https://github.com/ichord/At.js/wiki/Sites)
Hope you like it, Thanks.! :)

### Notice

At.js now **depends on** [Caret.js](https://github.com/ichord/Caret.js) and At.js will concat `Caret.js` into dist file.
And [here](http://ichord.github.io/Caret.js) is a Demo.

This branch have updated to `v0.3.2`. Please read **CHANGELOG.md** for more details.
English Documentation will keep improving. Maybe **You can do me a favor?!**
