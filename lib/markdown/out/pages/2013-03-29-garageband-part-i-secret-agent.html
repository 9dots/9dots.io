			<h2>GarageBand Part I: Secret Agent</h2>
			<h3>#digitalMedia #lessonPlan</h3>
			<article>
				<h2>Plus, a song that makes you want to dance, and one that makes you sleepy...</h2>
<p>For the first part of our week working with <a href="http://www.apple.com/ilife/garageband/">GarageBand</a>, students got a brief intro to the software and spent most of class trying out all the tools and effects that they could use in GarageBand.</p>
<p>To first familiarize our students with GarageBand, we had them follow along with an<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMuQchbJRG0"> introductory GarageBand tutorial on youtube</a>.  This tutorial goes over how to add loops, real instruments, and your voice, and how to do cool effects with your voice.</p>
<p>The loops used included the &quot;Secret Agent Theme&quot; loops, which were incredibly popular with our students, and we got a lot of laughs when the tutorial touched on how to record your own voice and edit the way it sounds (&quot;Hello, I&#39;m James Bond...&quot; sounds_<strong> very</strong> _different depending how high or low pitched your voice is!)</p>
<p>After completing the tutorial, students split into groups of 2-3 to make two tracks of their own.  One track had to make listeners feel like going to sleep, and the other had to make listeners want to dance!</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, several students asked about how to make dubstep in GarageBand.  Luckily, there are a bunch of tutorials on youtube that can show you how!</p>

<h4>Our basic lesson plan is below:</h4>
<h4>Introduction:</h4>
<p>Students follow along with this <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMuQchbJRG0">GarageBand tutorial</a>, then work on two tracks of their own.</p>
<h4><img src="http://9-dots.org/wp-includes/js/tinymce/plugins/wordpress/img/trans.gif" alt="">Materials:</h4>
<ul>
<li>computers with GarageBand installed</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>IMPORTANT:</strong> If this is your first time using GarageBand on your computer, you will need to set aside time to install the complete set of instruments and loops.  Otherwise, a lot of the options will be greyed out.  This normally should take 30-45 minutes, but with the Internet in our classroom it took almost 4 hours.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Project Time:</h4>
<p>90 minutes, but the students would have happily kept on working if we&#39;d had more time.  Allow at least half an hour for the tutorial.</p>
