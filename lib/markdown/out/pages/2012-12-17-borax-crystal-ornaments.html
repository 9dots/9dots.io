				<h2>Borax Crystal Ornaments</h2>
<p>For our last week of the fall semester, we were looking for some appropriately festive and science-y projects to celebrate the upcoming holidays. These sparkly ornaments combined with a short lesson on unsaturated and saturated solutions and crystallization ended up being super popular with our students.</p>
<p>Here’s a picture of the ornaments sitting in the borax and water solution. We left them overnight to crystallize but you can see crystals forming after just a couple of hours.</p>

<p>Unfortunately we forgot to take pictures of the finished ornaments. We had so many awesome ones too – several students made a “9” to stand for the 9 in 9 Dots, and we also had penguin, snowman, and candy cane ornaments! To see an example of borax crystal ornaments, hop on over to food.com’s <a href="http://www.food.com/recipe/crystal-ornaments-borax-145914">recipe for the ornaments</a>.</p>
<p>Some thoughts – food coloring makes the process more fun but the colors don’t show up strongly in the crystals. Also, putting more borax in is definitely better than not enough. Gotta make sure the solution is supersaturated!</p>
<p>Our basic lesson plan is below:</p>
<h4>Introduction:</h4>
<p>Students will learn about unsaturated, saturated, and saturated solutions, and learn what causes the borax crystals to form.</p>
<!-- more -->


<h4>Materials and Costs:</h4>
<ul>
<li>1 large, clear plastic cup per student</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Craft sticks</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>String</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Borax</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Hot or boiling water</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Food coloring (optional)</li>
</ul>
<h4>Handouts and Other Media:</h4>
<p><a href="www.youtube.com/watch?v=mxO9rtVjoR4">Video of sodium acetate (hot ice) crystals forming</a>, to show an example of rapid crystallization</p>
<h4>Preparation Time:</h4>
<p>Approximately 15 minutes</p>
<h4>Preparation Tasks:</h4>
<p>Divide project materials for each team.</p>
<h4>Project Time:</h4>
<p>1 hour 15 minutes</p>
<h4>Lesson Plan Breakdown:</h4>
<p>_1. Saturated &amp; Unsaturated Solutions [10 minutes] _Talk about unsaturated, saturated, and supersaturated solutions and what causes crystallization. Show the video of sodium acetate crystals forming and explain the science behind it.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>_Making the ornaments [20 minutes _Students will use pipe cleaners to design and make their own ornaments. They should use string to tie the ornaments to the craft stick or something else that can rest across the top of the plastic cups. Make sure the students understand that the ornaments should fit in the cups without touching the bottom or sides, so that the ornaments do not get stuck after crystallization happens.</p>
</li>
<li><p>_Adding the borax/water solution [5-10 minutes per group] _Add borax and water to each student’s plastic cups. Pouring the water should be done by an adult as the water is extremely hot. We used close to boiling water and followed the formula we found online of 3 tbs borax for each cup of boiling water.</p>
