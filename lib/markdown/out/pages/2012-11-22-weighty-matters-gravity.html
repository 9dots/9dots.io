<h2>Marble Roller Coaster Part 1</h2>
<h4>Introduction:</h4>
<p>Students will will learn about gravity and potential and kinetic energy as they design a marble roller coaster track.</p>
<h4>Objectives:</h4>
<p>Students will learn about gravity and potential and kinetic energy with this hands on project.</p>
<h4>Materials and Costs:</h4>
<ul>
<li>9 ft of halved pipe insulation per team</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>marbles</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>tape (duct or painters)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>plastic cup</li>
</ul>
<h4>Handouts and Other Media:</h4>
<h4>Preparation Time:</h4>
<p>Approximately 30 minutes</p>
<h4>Preparation Tasks:</h4>
<p>Halve insulation tubes.  Make short presentation about gravity.</p>
<h4>Project Time:</h4>
<p>1 hour 30 minutes</p>
<h4>Lesson Plan Breakdown:</h4>
<p>_1. What is Gravity? [5 minutes] _Begin by discussing with students what they know about gravity.  Discuss that gravity gives weight to objects and causes them to fall to the ground when dropped.</p>
<ol>
<li>_How much do things weigh? [5 minutes] _Discuss how your weight depends on the gravity where you are, so theoretically things would weigh much less on the moon and much more on the sun.</li>
</ol>
<p><em>3. How do things fall? [5 minutes]</em>  Begin by asking students how things fall (ie at the same speed?).  Explain that on earth, objects fall at 9.81 m/s2, meaning that objects get faster and faster the farther they fall.  For example, a penny falling from the Empire State Building can get up to 100 mph by the time a penny reaches the ground.</p>
<p>_4. How does gravity help roller coasters? [5 minutes]  _Have the students brainstorm how gravity effects roller coasters.  Make sure to touch on the fact that it takes work to lift the roller coaster of the ground.</p>
<p>Explain that when the roller coaster car (or marble) is lifted on the ground, it has potential energy.  Then, as it falls down the track, the potential energy is converted into kinetic energy.  The coaster would not have this energy without using work to lift it off the ground in the first place.</p>
<p><em>5. Build! [1 hour 10 minutes] </em> Challenge the students to make a roller coater track with 2 hills and 1 vertical loop.  For a bonus, when students are finished they can combine tracks with another team to make a coaster with 4 hills and 2 vertical loops.</p>

<h2>Egg Drop</h2>
<h4>Introduction:</h4>

<h4>Handouts and Other Media:</h4>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7f-K-XnHi9I">Felix Baumgartner video</a></p>
<h4>Preparation Time:</h4>
<p>10 minutes</p>
<h4>Preparation Tasks:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Have all materials laid out on a table in the center.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Lay out plastic bags on the ground of the dropping site.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Project Time:</h4>
<p>1 hour 30 minutes</p>
<h4>Lesson Plan Breakdown:</h4>
<p>_1. What is Gravity? [5 minutes] _Begin by reviewing with students what they know about gravity.  Discuss that gravity gives weight to objects and causes them to fall to the ground when dropped.</p>
<p><em>2. How do things fall? [15 minutes]</em>  Review with students how things fall (ie at the same speed?).  Explain that on earth, objects fall at 9.81 m/s2, meaning that objects get faster and faster the farther they fall.  For example, a penny falling from the Empire State Building can get up to 100 mph by the time a penny reaches the ground.</p>
<p>Show highlights from the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7f-K-XnHi9I">Felix Baumgartner video</a>.  Note how Felix’s speed continues to increase as he falls and that he uses a parachute to slow him down as he approaches land.</p>
<p>_ 3. How can we fight gravity? [5 minutes] _Discuss with students some ways that we typically fight gravity such as parachutes, helium balloons, or rockets.</p>
<p>_4. Research [10 minutes] _Give students about 10 minutes to research egg drop structures online and brainstorm their designs.</p>
<p>_5. Choose m__aterials [10 minutes]  _Have each team draw a number, which will determine what order they are able to choose their materials. Each group takes turns choosing materials, with 4 materials total.</p>
<p>_6. Build [30 minutes] _Give students 30 minutes to build their structure.</p>
<p>_7. Test [15 minutes] _Test students’ structures by dropping them from the second story of a building.</p>

<h2>Pumpkin Towers</h2>
<h4>Introduction:</h4>
<p>Students will be challenged to build tall towers out of printer paper and tape that are strong enough to hold several pumpkins on top.  (Our Halloween project!)</p>
<h4> </h4>
<h4> </h4>
<h4>Objectives:</h4>
<p>Students will continue learning about gravity, this time in the context of how structures work to hold up weighty objects.</p>
<h4>Materials and Costs:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Printer paper (5 pieces per team)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Tape (masking or scotch)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Paper plate (1 per team)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Large weight (we used mini pumpkins)</li>
</ul>
<h4>Handouts and Other Media:</h4>
<h4>Preparation Time:</h4>
<p>Approximately 5 minutes</p>
<h4>Preparation Tasks:</h4>
<p>Distribute paper and tape to all teams.</p>
<h4>Project Time:</h4>
<p>1 hour 30 minutes</p>
<h4>Lesson Plan Breakdown:</h4>
<p>_1. What is Gravity? [5 minutes] _Begin by reviewing with students what they know about gravity.  Discuss that gravity gives weight to objects and causes them to fall to the ground when dropped.</p>
<ol>
<li><p><em>How is this building holding me up? [5 minutes]</em> Discuss with students how buildings work.  Particularly, ask them why, if you are standing on the second floor of a building with a room underneath you, does the floor not collapse?  Lead them to the point that the structural walls are bearing most of the weight.__</p>
</li>
<li><p><em>Tension and Compression [5 minutes]</em>  Introduce the concepts of tension and compression.  Have students clasp their hands and pull outwards.  This is tension.  Now have students clasp their hands and press inwards.  This is compression.  Explain that tension and compression are forces that allow buildings to stand up even under tremendous weights.</p>
</li>
<li><p>_Build [1 hour 15 minutes] _Challenge students to use 5 pieces of printer paper to hold as many pumpkins ~11 inches in the air.  As students finish, challenge them to try the structure ~22 inches high, and ~33  inches high.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<h2>Marble Roller Coaster Part 2</h2>
<h4>Introduction:</h4>
<p>Students will revisit concepts of gravity and potential and kinetic energy as they design rollercoaster towers.</p>
<h4>Objectives:</h4>
<p>Students will continue learning about gravity and potential and kinetic energy with this hands on project.</p>
<h4>Materials and Costs:</h4>
<ul>
<li>card stock (65 lb) about 3 pieces per student</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>scotch tape</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>scissors</li>
</ul>
<h4>Handouts and Other Media:</h4>
<h4>Preparation Time:</h4>
<p>Approximately 30 minutes</p>
<h4>Preparation Tasks:</h4>
<p>Cut ~1.5 inch strips of card stock.</p>
<h4>Project Time:</h4>
<p>1 hour 30 minutes</p>
<h4>Lesson Plan Breakdown:</h4>
<p>_1. What is Gravity? [5 minutes] R_eview with students what they know about gravity.  Discuss that gravity gives weight to objects and causes them to fall to the ground when dropped.</p>
<p>_2. How does gravity help roller coasters? [5 minutes]  _Review how gravity effects roller coasters.  Make sure to touch on the fact that it takes work to lift the roller coaster of the ground.</p>
<p>Explain that when the roller coaster car (or marble) is lifted on the ground, it has potential energy.  Then, as it falls down the track, the potential energy is converted into kinetic energy.  The coaster would not have this energy without using work to lift it off the ground in the first place.</p>
<p><em>5. Build! [1 hour 10 minutes] </em> Challenge the students to make a roller coater track out of their card stock.  Give students the choice of building a tall track by working with their classmates, or making a shorter track that they can take home.</p>
<p>In order to build the coaster, all students need to do is fold each piece of card stock in half the long way.  Then, each student should start by making the frame of the track, which is a cube.  Then they can add the track onto the frame.</p>
