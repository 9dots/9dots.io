<h2>Introducing the Mindstorm NXT</h2>
<h4>Introduction:</h4>
<p>The first project is a simple introduction to computer programming, the NXT, its peripherals, and the basics of the Mindstorm software.</p>
<h4>Objectives:</h4>
<p>During the first project, students will learn to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Connect the Mindstorm to the computer</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Download a program to the Mindstorm</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Run the program</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Incorporate the sensors and servos</li>
</ul>
<h4>Materials and Costs:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Lego Mindstorm NXT kit.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Handouts and Other Media:</h4>
<p>Video for MINDSTORM <strong><a href="http://mindstorms.lego.com/en-us/funzone/movies/default.aspx">here</a>.</strong></p>
<h4>Preparation Time:</h4>
<p>10 minutes</p>
<h4>Preparation Tasks:</h4>
<p>Set up a maze using tape for the instructor to walk through. Pass out NXT kits and make sure to explain the importance of keeping pieces organized.</p>
<h4>Project Time:</h4>
<p>1 hour</p>
<h4>Lesson Plan Breakdown:</h4>
<p><em>1. What is programming [15 minutes]?</em></p>
<p>Ask students what they think computer programming and what examples are.   Explain that programming is used to give a specific set of instructions for a computer to execute. It is used in computers, computer software, video games, websites, cars, and many house-hold appliances. Have students write instructions for teacher to walk through a maze. Follow instructions exactly.</p>
<p><em>2. What is a robot [10 minutes]?</em></p>
<p>Ask students what they think a robot is. A robot is a device that can perform tasks automatically. Explain that robots are programmed to operate on their own. Show MINDSTORM video.</p>
<p><em>3. Introduce MINDSTORM [35 minutes]</em></p>
<p>__Introduce the sensors and programming blocks associated with them. Have the students play with the blocks and test results. Explain that when a block is selected the options show up at the bottom of the screen. They should write multi-block programs for each peripheral.</p>

<p><strong>Light sensor:</strong> Have the students write the different brightness for a red ball vs. a blue one. Determine what the output is for other colors such as green.</p>
<p><a href="http://9-dots.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/ultrasonic.jpg"><img src="http://9-dots.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/ultrasonic.jpg" alt=""></a><strong>Ultrasonic sensor (Distance):</strong> Make the Mindstorm display a smiley face if an object is less that 8 inches away.</p>
<p><a href="http://9-dots.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/motor.jpg"><img src="http://9-dots.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/motor.jpg" alt=""></a></p>
<p><strong>Motors:</strong> Spin the motor for 3 seconds, and then for 95 degrees.</p>
<p><a href="http://9-dots.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/touch_sensor.jpg"><img src="http://9-dots.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/touch_sensor.jpg" alt=""></a></p>
<p><strong>Touch sensor:</strong> Make the Mindstorm beep when the touch sensor is activated.</p>
<p><a href="http://9-dots.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/sound_sensor.jpg"><img src="http://9-dots.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/sound_sensor.jpg" alt=""></a><strong>Sound sensor:</strong> The Mindstorm should speak when it hears a sound.</p>
<h4>Discussion Questions:</h4>
<ol>
<li>Is the MINDSTORM a robot? Why or why not?</li>

<h2>Building your robot</h2>
<h4>Introduction:</h4>
<p>Build the basic robot design following the instructions provided by LEGO in the Mindstorm kits. Once it is built the students will add basic functionality using the skills gained from day 1.</p>
<h4>Objective:</h4>
<p>Create a functioning robot that can drive and make use of its sensors.  Introduce the drop menus in blocks for more advanced control.</p>
<h4>Materials and Costs:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Lego Mindstorm NXT kit.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Preparation Time:</h4>
<p>No preparation required.</p>
<h4>Preparation Tasks:</h4>
<p>None.</p>
<h4>Project Time:</h4>
<p>1 hour</p>
<h4>Lesson Plan Breakdown:</h4>
<p><em>1. Advanced menus [5 minutes]</em></p>
<p>Demonstrate that when a block is clicked on its bottom edge a drop-down menu appears. Hovering over the icons in the menu will give a description of various input and output options.  A simple example is to get a sound sensor block (yellow) and a move block (green) and expose their drop downs. Connect the output of the sound sensor into the power input for the move block. This will make it so the louder it is, the faster the motor will spin.</p>
<p><em>2. Robot building [35 minutes]?</em></p>
<p>Each team should have a Mindstorm kit in front of them. Inside each kit is building instructions for the basic robot.  Have teams assemble the robots exactly as it is described in the instructions. They should stop after they get to the light sensor that is faced down.</p>
<p><em>3. Program MINDSTORM [25 minutes]</em></p>
<p>As an introduction to the drop down menus, have the students program their robot to slow down as it approaches and object, and then stop when it gets within 8 inches.  To accomplish this they will need to connect the output from the ultrasonic sensor to the power input on the motor block. To stop the robot they will also need to use a wait block and set it to wait for the ultrasonic sensor to be less than 8 inches.</p>

<h2>Walk the line</h2>
<h4>Introduction:</h4>
<p>Build the basic robot design following the instructions provided by LEGO in the Mindstorm kits. The robot will then be programmed to follow the a black line that has curves. You can make one with tape or use one that comes with the NXT kit.</p>
<h4>Objective:</h4>
<p>Create a robot that can follow a black line. Once basic functionality is achieved, challenges should be added including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Having the robot follow the line for a given amount of time before turning around and following it the other way. (not too difficult)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Make the robot follow the line until it gets to an obstacle.  Have it drive around the obstacle and continue on the line. (more difficult)</li>
</ul>
<h4>Materials and Costs:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Lego Mindstorm NXT kit.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Preparation Time:</h4>
<p>No preparation required.</p>
<h4>Preparation Tasks:</h4>
<p>Set up a black line.</p>
<h4>Project Time:</h4>
<p>1 hour</p>
<h4>Lesson Plan Breakdown:</h4>
<p><em>1. Robot building [35 minutes]?</em></p>
<p>Depending on how much is built from the previous day the length need for this task could change.  The only integral parts for this challenge are the basic driving module, the light sensor (faced down), and the ultrasonic sensor (for the challenge).</p>
<p><em>2. Program MINDSTORM [25 minutes]</em></p>
<p>Using what they have learned so far, the students will attempt to make the robot follow a black line.  The simplest way to achieve this is to have the robot zig-zag across the line and follow the edge of the line between the white and the black.  More complicated approaches can be found <a href="http://www.nxtprograms.com/line_follower/steps.html">here</a>.</p>
