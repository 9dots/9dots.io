				<p>For the second part of our week working with <a href="http://makeymakey.com">MaKey MaKey</a> &amp; <a href="http://scratch.mit.edu">Scratch</a>, students designed their own mazes that could be navigated using the arrow keys or the MaKey MaKey! For a brief intro to MaKey MaKey and Scratch, click <a href="http://9-dots.org/its-electric-week-2-fun-with-sprites/">here</a> for our post on the previous day&#39;s project.</p>
<p>To make a maze, students needed to create two ‘sprites’: the maze itself, and a sprite (person, animal, or anything else the student wanted) that would be navigating the maze. Students could try out the maze by navigating the sprite using the arrow keys. Students added code to make the sprite stop when it ran into walls (and sometimes make a funny sound effect when that happened). After figuring out how to build the maze in Scratch, students hooked up the MaKey MaKey for more interactive fun!</p>

<p>Like in our previous project with Scratch and MaKey MaKey, we had a table set up with a bunch of different conductive and non-conductive materials such as paper, pennies, twizzlers, lemons, aluminum foil, straws, etc. that the kids could attach to the MaKey MaKey to play the maze.</p>
<h3>Our basic lesson plan is below:</h3>
<h4>Introduction:</h4>
<p>Students will learn basic coding using Scratch and combine that with what they have learned about using the MaKey MaKey</p>
<!-- more -->


<h4>Materials:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Conductive materials such as lemons, gummy candies, paper clips, pennies, etc</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Conductive play dough (see <a href="http://courseweb.stthomas.edu/apthomas/SquishyCircuits/">squishy circuits</a>)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Non-conductive materials for kids to test (straws, paper, cotton balls, etc)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>MaKey MaKey</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Computers with Scratch installed</li>
</ul>
<h4>Handouts and Other Media:</h4>
<p>There is a great example maze that comes with the Scratch installation, which you can find if you go to File &gt; Open &gt; Examples &gt; Games &gt; Pacman that we encouraged the students to play around with.</p>
<h4>Preparation Time:</h4>
<p>Approximately 10 minutes</p>
<h4>Preparation Tasks:</h4>
<p>Set out project materials at front of room.</p>
<h4>Project Time:</h4>
<p>60-90 minutes</p>
<h4>Lesson Plan Breakdown:</h4>
<p>We went over the code in the example Pacman maze for 10 minutes or so, making sure that the students understood what the individual code blocks did. We also reviewed how to draw your own sprite, and pick from the pre-made sprites. Students then spent the rest of the time creating their own mazes.</p>
<p>The most challenging part was actually drawing the maze, since it&#39;s a bit of a challenge getting the right scale. The drawing tool in Scratch does not draw true to size, and the mazes that students drew were much smaller than they appeared in the drawing tool.</p>
