				<h2>Fun with sprites in Scratch + MaKey MaKey</h2>
<p>For our second week of working with the MaKey MaKey, we added a new element:  computer programming with a fun, kid-friendly program called <a href="http://scratch.mit.edu">Scratch</a>.</p>
<p>[caption id=&quot;attachment_349&quot; align=&quot;alignright&quot; width=&quot;458&quot;]<a href="http://9-dots.org/wp-uploads/2013/03/Screen-shot-2013-03-11-at-12.30.41-AM1.png"><img src="http://9-dots.org/wp-uploads/2013/03/Screen-shot-2013-03-11-at-12.30.41-AM1.png" alt=""></a> Here&#39;s a screenshot of the Scratch interface[/caption]</p>
<p>Instead of writing code from scratch (no pun intended), Scratch allows users to connect various pre-made code &#39;blocks&#39; that are color coded by type.   But don&#39;t be fooled by its friendly interface- Scratch is a powerful program that gives students a lot of freedom and flexibility to create any program they want.</p>
<p>Our project was based on a great <a href="https://cs-third.wikispaces.com/Scratch+and+MakeyMakey">Scratch + MaKey MaKey</a> lesson plan from the Collegiate School&#39;s Third Grade Technology Wiki.  Students created four &#39;sprites&#39;, or characters, in Scratch- they could choose from pre-made ones, or draw their own.  Then they put together code that could do things like change the colors of the sprite, move the sprites, make the sprites talk, etc whenever different arrow keys or the space bar were pressed.</p>
<p>For example, in the code below, when the space bar is pressed, one of the sprites will turn 15 degrees and meow:</p>
<p><a href="http://9-dots.org/wp-uploads/2013/03/Screen-shot-2013-03-11-at-12.32.19-AM1.png"><img src="http://9-dots.org/wp-uploads/2013/03/Screen-shot-2013-03-11-at-12.32.19-AM1.png" alt=""></a></p>
<p>For the final part of the project, students hooked up the MaKey MaKey to their computers, and were asked to pick at least 5 different materials from a selection we had in the front of the classroom, that would conduct electricity and that they could use with the MaKey MaKey.  Some of the materials worked and some didn&#39;t - it was up to the students to choose.  Kids especially loved trying out things like lemons and twizzlers to see if they worked! (Hint - they do. Click <a href="http://science.yourdictionary.com/articles/how-does-lemon-juice-conduct-electricity.html">here</a> for an explanation of why lemons work.</p>
<p>With the MaKey MaKey hooked up,  kids could then use the materials they chose to control their on-screen sprites.</p>

<h3>Our basic lesson plan is below:</h3>
<h4>Introduction:</h4>
<p>Students will learn basic coding using Scratch and combine that with what they have learned about using the MaKey MaKey</p>
<!-- more -->


<h4>Materials:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Conductive materials such as lemons, gummy candies, paper clips, pennies, etc</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Conductive play dough (see <a href="http://courseweb.stthomas.edu/apthomas/SquishyCircuits/">squishy circuits</a>)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Non conductive materials for kids to test (straws, paper, cotton balls, etc)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>MaKey MaKey</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Computers with Scratch installed</li>
</ul>
<h4>Handouts and Other Media:</h4>
<p>Examples from the <a href="https://cs-third.wikispaces.com/Scratch+and+MakeyMakey">CS-Third lesson plan</a></p>
<h4>Preparation Time:</h4>
<p>Approximately 30 minutes</p>
<h4>Preparation Tasks:</h4>
<p>Set out project materials at front of room.</p>
<h4>Project Time:</h4>
<p>60-90 minutes</p>
<h4>Lesson Plan Breakdown:</h4>
<p>We combined the <a href="https://cs-third.wikispaces.com/Scratch+and+MakeyMakey">CS-Third lesson plan</a> into an hour and a half, with the majority of the time spent working in Scratch since the students were familiar with the MaKey MaKey.</p>
