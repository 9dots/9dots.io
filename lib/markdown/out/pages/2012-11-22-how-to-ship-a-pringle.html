	<h2>The Pringles Challenge: How to Ship a Pringle</h2>
<h4>Introduction:</h4>
<p>Students will design packaging to send a single Pringles chip safely through UPS. It’s a fun variation on the egg drop, especially given the limitations on mass and volume (smaller and lighter is better, in this case).</p>
<h4>Objectives:</h4>
<p>In addition to basic engineering and package design, students will also learn about mass and volume, and review long division with decimals.</p>

<h4>Materials and Costs:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Pringles chips (1 chip per team, plus more to allow for chip breakage)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>1 legal-sized envelope per team</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>3 index cards per team</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>scotch tape</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>2 straws per team</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>2 popsicle sticks per team</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>scale to measure mass</li>
</ul>
<h4>Handouts and Other Media:</h4>
<ul>
<li>How Stuff Works video on <a href="http://money.howstuffworks.com/ups1.htm">How UPS Works</a></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Handout with scoring criteria (many versions can be found online)</li>
</ul>

<h4>Preparation Time:</h4>
<p>Approximately 15 minutes</p>
<h4>Preparation Tasks:</h4>
<p>Divide project materials into envelopes for each team.</p>
<h4>Project Time:</h4>
<p>1 hour 10 minutes</p>
<h4>Lesson Plan Breakdown:</h4>
<p>_1. Introduction [5 minutes] _Begin by introducing the Pringles Challenge and the rules of the challenge.  Review the concepts of mass and volume.</p>
<ol>
<li>_How does UPS work? [5 minutes] _Show the video on How UPS Works, and ask the students to note how many times each package is picked up, dropped, thrown, transferred, etc.</li>
</ol>
<p><em>3. How will you be scored? [5 minutes]</em>  Review the scoring system and formulas.  Students are asked to list their results on the board.  Point out that mass should be measured in grams, volume in cc, and go over how to calculate the final score (order of operations is key!)</p>
<p><em>5. Build! [45 minutes] </em> Students have 45 minutes to design and build their packages. They may use any of the materials in the envelope, including the envelope itself, which they can cut up if they choose.  Note that nothing can be directly taped to the Pringles chip.</p>
<ol>
<li>_Testing [10 minutes per group] _Each group must first measure the mass and volume of their packages.  Volume of irregular packages should be estimated.  Due to cost constraints, instead of actually sending through UPS, our students dropped their packages 5 times each from shoulder height.  The chips were scored based on “intactness” after testing, on a scale of 1-100, and the final score is calculated by dividing the intactness by (mass x volume).</li>
</ol>
